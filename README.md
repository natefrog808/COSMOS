## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Architecture

COSMOS is built on a React-inspired architecture using the Daydreams framework, featuring:

### Core Components

1. **Context System**: Maintains rich state with React-like rendering
   ```javascript
   const automationContext = context({
     type: "computer-automation",
     schema: z.object({...}),
     create(state) {...},
     render({memory}) {...}
   });
   ```

2. **Action Framework**: Modular capabilities with standardized interfaces
   ```javascript
   const analyzeScreenAction = action({
     name: "analyzeScreen",
     description: "Analyze screen for UI elements",
     schema: z.object({...}),
     async handler(call, ctx, agent) {...}
   });
   ```

3. **Computer Vision Engine**: OpenCV-backed element detection
   ```javascript
   const image = cv.imdecode(screenshotBuffer);
   const grayImg = image.cvtColor(cv.COLOR_BGR2GRAY);
   const edges = grayImg.canny(50, 150);
   const contours = edges.findContours(cv.RETR_EXTERNAL, cv.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE);
   ```

4. **OCR Processing**: Text extraction and analysis
   ```javascript
   const worker = await createWorker();
   await worker.loadLanguage('eng');
   await worker.initialize('eng');
   const { data } = await worker.recognize(screenshotBuffer);
   ```

5. **Cognitive Layer**: Claude-powered reasoning
   ```javascript
   const agent = await createDreams({
     model: anthropic("claude-3-opus-20240229"),
     extensions: [cli],
     context: automationContext,
     actions: [...]
   });
   ```

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ using nvm
- Anthropic API key

### Installation

```bash
# Install core dependencies
npm install @daydreamsai/core @ai-sdk/anthropic zod

# Install automation dependencies
npm install robotjs screenshot-desktop tesseract.js opencv4nodejs active-win node-fetch node-notifier
```

### Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file:
```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### Quick Start

```javascript
import { createDreams } from "@daydreamsai/core";
import { COSMOS } from "./cosmos";

// Initialize COSMOS
const cosmos = await COSMOS.initialize({
  workspaceName: "My Automation Project"
});

// Start the agent
cosmos.start();
```

---

## üíª Example Usage

### Basic Interactions

```javascript
// Take a screenshot and analyze it
await cosmos.run("takeScreenshot");
await cosmos.run("analyzeScreen");

// Find and click a button
const elements = await cosmos.run("findElement", { 
  text: "Submit", 
  type: "button" 
});
await cosmos.run("interactWithElement", {
  elementId: elements[0].id,
  action: "click"
});
```

### Complex Workflow Automation

```javascript
// Record a pattern for later reuse
await cosmos.run("addTask", {
  description: "Process new invoices",
  priority: "high"
});

// Perform the multi-step task
await cosmos.run("takeScreenshot");
await cosmos.run("findElement", { text: "Invoice" });
await cosmos.run("interactWithElement", { 
  elementText: "Invoice", 
  action: "click" 
});
await cosmos.run("typeText", { text: "INV-2023-0042" });
await cosmos.run("pressKey", { key: "tab" });
await cosmos.run("typeText", { text: "Client XYZ" });

// Record this workflow as a pattern
await cosmos.run("recordPattern", {
  name: "processInvoice",
  description: "Process a new invoice with client information"
});
```

### System Monitoring

```javascript
// Get system details
const sysInfo = await cosmos.run("getSystemInfo");
console.log(`CPU: ${sysInfo.cpuModel} with ${sysInfo.cpuCores} cores`);
console.log(`Memory: ${sysInfo.freeMemory} free of ${sysInfo.totalMemory}`);

// Check which application is active
const windowInfo = await cosmos.run("detectActiveWindow");
console.log(`Current application: ${windowInfo.title} (${windowInfo.owner.name})`);
```

- Contour detection for shapes
- Text association for labeling
- Layout analysis for grouping
- Historical interaction data

### Pattern Recognition
The agent builds a knowledge base of common UI patterns:
- Buttons, dropdown menus, checkboxes
- Form fields, tables, navigation bars
- Modal dialogs, tooltips, notifications

### Error Recovery
COSMOS implements sophisticated error handling:
- Auto-retry with progressive strategies
- Visual verification of expected results
- Rollback capabilities for failed operations
- Detailed error reporting for debugging

## üîê Security Considerations

COSMOS prioritizes security through:

- **Sandboxed Execution**: Limited system access based on user-defined permissions
- **Action Verification**: Confirmation of potentially destructive operations
- **Data Protection**: No persistent storage of sensitive information
- **Network Controls**: Configurable network access rules
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive records of all agent actions
